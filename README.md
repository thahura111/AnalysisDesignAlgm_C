# AnalysisDesignAlgm_C
Programs in C in the subject of "Analysis and Design of Algorithms" for 5th sem BCA students. 

This has programs in C language for :

Part A : 
1.  Recursive binary search and linear search and determine the time taken
2.  Maximum and minimum numbers in an array using the divide and conquer technique
3.  Sort a given set of elements using the quick sort method and determine the time taken
4.  Implement the mergesort algorithm to sort a given set of elements and determine the time taken
5.  Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using Prim’s algorithm
6.  Find All pairs shortest path problem using Floyd’s algorithm
7.  Compute the transitive closure of a given directed graph using Warshall's algorithm
8.  Shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm
9.  Given a Binary tree, implement recursive in-order, pre-order and post-order tree traversals
10. Write a program to check whether a given graph is connected or not using DFS method.
11. Find a subset of a given set S = {sl, s2,....., sn} of n positive integers whose sum is equal to a given positive integer d. For example, if S= {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 there are two solutions {1, 2, 6} and {1,8}
12. Program to implement the N Queens problem using back tracking

Part B :
1. Linear search (non-recursive way)
2. Binary search (non-recursive way)
3. Find sum of elements in array in recursive way
4. Write a program for finding Fibonacci series using recursion
5. Write a program to show Bubblesort
6. Find factorial of a number
7. Write a program for 0/1 knapsack problem
8. Write a program for  knapsack problem
9. Print all nodes in graph using DFS
10. Print all nodes in graph using BFS
